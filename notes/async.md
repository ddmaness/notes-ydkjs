# Async and Performance

``` javascript

```

## Chapter 1: Asynchrony Now and Later
What is at the heart of asynchronous programming?


What will most likely be console.logged here and why?
``` javascript
// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
var data = ajax( "http://some.url.1" );

console.log( data );
```
Why is it called a callback function?

Why can the setTimeout() function not guarantee that your code will be executed precisely when it says
it will?

What is the difference between the terms "async" and "parallel"?

What does it mean to state that JS has "run to completion" behavior?

What does the term "race condition" mean?

Define concurrency as it pertains to JS.

when is nondeterminism in async behavior acceptable?

what is wrong with this code and what is one way to fix it?
``` javascript
var res = [];

function response(data) {
	res.push( data );
}

// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
ajax( "http://some.url.1", response );
ajax( "http://some.url.2", response );
```


what is wrong with this code and what is one way to fix it?
``` javascript
var a, b;

function foo(x) {
	a = x * 2;
	baz();
}

function bar(y) {
	b = y * 2;
	baz();
}

function baz() {
	console.log(a + b);
}

// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
ajax( "http://some.url.1", foo );
ajax( "http://some.url.2", bar );
```

what is a "latch" condition and how is it different from a "race" condition?

What is one method of avoiding hogging the event loop (and locking up the UI) while processing huge amounts of data

how is the es6 job queue different from the event loop?

Describe jobs and event loops in terms of an amusement park ride.

Describe to basic patterns for dealing with concurrency interaction

## Chapter 2: Callbacks

Define a "callback"

In what order will the following functions fire?
``` javascript
doA( function(){
	doB();

	doC( function(){
		doD();
	} )

	doE();
} );

doF();
```

Describe "inversion of controll" why is it a problem?

What does it mean to "not release zalgo"?

What are the two main problems with using callbacks for asynchronous code?

## Chapter 3: Promises

Promises are ______________ and therefore safe to pass around

What is the most reliable way to check if the value returned by a function is a promise?

How do promises correct the "calling too early" trust issuae?

How do promises correct the "calling too lated" trust issue?

You should avoid coding in such a way where the ordering/scheduling of _____________ matters.

How do promises correct the "never calling the callback" trust issue?

How do promises correct the "calling too few/many times" trust issue?

How do promises correct the "Failing to Pass along any parameters/environment" issue?

How is an error in a promise handled?

how is an error in a then() registered callback handled?

How can you ensure you gain trust from any thenable or thenable-like value?

Every time you call then() on a promise it creates ______________ that you can then _________.

Whatever value you return from the then() call's fullfilment callback (its first parameter) is
automatically set as the ________________________________.

what gets console.logged in the  p2 and p2.then?
``` javascript
var p = Promise.resolve( 21 );

var p2 = p.then( function(v){
	console.log( v );

	// fulfill `p2`
	return v * 2;
} );

// chain off `p2`
p2.then( function(v){
	console.log( v );
} );
```

Identify the sync part of this code and describe how to make it async.
```javascript
var p = Promise.resolve( 21 );

p
.then( function(v){
	console.log( v );	// 21

	// fulfill the chained promise with value `42`
	return v * 2;
} )
// here's the chained promise
.then( function(v){
	console.log( v );	// 42
} );
```

What happens if you omit a rejection or fulfillment handler and it is need in the promise chain?

What is the recommended name convention for the first and second params in a Promise constructor declaration?

Describe the Promise.all([..]) pattern.

Describe the Promise.race([..]) pattern.


>>>> START FLASHCARDS HERE<<<< remember to always attach a __________________ to every promise.

Describe the major limitations of promises.


## Chapter 4 Generators

What problem with async callback code is solved with promises?

What problem with async callback code is solved with generators?

What is the primary way that generators are different from typical functions?

What es6 syntax allows you to pause code?

What is the difference between how values are returned in generators vs how hey are returned in
normal functions?

Describe "iteration messaging" and how it is used.

## Chapter 6 Benchmarking

Why should you consider using a utility like benchmark.js to test program speed instead of rolling your 
own?

What is "paving the cowpath" and why is it a bad idea?

Only bother with optimazation in a ________________ path.

What are some examples of "Critical Paths" in a program?

When optimizing for performance, what other factor needs to be considered?

What is "Tail Call Optimization"?
