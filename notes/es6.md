# YDKJS ES6 & Beyond

## Chapter 1: ES? Now & Future

Can you explain how closures are a direct result of lexical scope and functions as values?

Can you recite the four simple rules for how this is bound?

Ever heard of objects linked to other objects (OLOO)?

Have you been muddling through fake "classes" in JS instead of adopting the simpler "behavior delegation" design pattern?

What is the difference between a shim/polyfill and transpiling?

What is the point of the outer if statment in this code snippet?
```
if (!Object.is) {
	Object.is = function(v1, v2) {
		// test for `-0`
		if (v1 === 0 && v2 === 0) {
			return 1 / v1 === 1 / v2;
		}
		// test for `NaN`
		if (v1 !== v1) {
			return v2 !== v2;
		}
		// everything else
		return v1 === v2;
	};
}
```
going forward it is likely that browsers will start rolling out support for features continually so what
two steps should you get in the habit of doing now?

## Chapter 2: Syntax

Always place let declared variables at the =========== of the block in which they are declared because unlike
var =======================

What of the advantage of declaring the iterator variable of for loops with let instead of var?

Const restricts the ================== not the value itself

What's wrong with this block of code?
```javascript
{
	const a = [1,2,3];
	a.push( 4 );
	console.log( a );

	a = 42;
}
```
Don rely on cont for code behavior, instead think of it as signaling =============

What does TDZ stand for and what idea does it convey?

What is the most typical use cas for using the spread operator (...) in front of arrays?

Pre es6 how could you spread the elements of an array for use as arguments?

In addition to spreading the ... operator can be used to ================.

What will be console.logged in each of these calls and why?
```javascript
function foo(x = 11, y = 31) {
	console.log( x + y );
}

foo();
foo( 5, 6 );
foo( 0, 42 );

foo( 5 );
foo( 5, undefined );
foo( 5, null );

foo( undefined, 6 );
foo( null, 6 );	
```

Describe es6 destructuring and how it is used.

What will be console.logged here in es6?
```javascript
function bar() {
	return {
		x: 4,
		y: 5,
		z: 6
	};
}

var { x: bam, y: baz, z: bap } = bar();
console.log( bam, baz, bap);

console.log( x, y, z );

var { x = 5, y = 10, z = 15, w = 20 } = bar();
console.log( x, y, z );

var { x, y, z, w: WW = 20 } = bar();
console.log( x, y, z, WW );
```

How could the following be rewritten using es6 syntax's concise properties?
```javascript
var x = 2, y = 3,
	o = {
		x: x,
		y: y
	};
```

How could the following be rewritten using es6 syntax's concise methods? What other ability does this open up?
```javascript
var o = {

	}
}
```

	return x + y;
}
```

leaving off the curly braces in an es6 arrow function with one expression means you can omit=============.

curly braces are required in es6 arrow functions if ================.

arrow functions are always Anonymous function ================ never ====================.

Arrow functions are most appropriate for ===================== functions.

How is `this` bound differently in arrow functions?

What rules determine if arrow functions are appropriate or not?

statement itself?

working with strings that contain =========================.

## Chapter 3: Oganization

What is the return value of es6 iterators?

What will be returned in each of these .next() calls?
```javascript
var arr = [1,2,3];

var it = arr[Symbol.iterator]();

it.next();
it.next();
it.next();

it.next();
```

What happens if you call next() on an iterator that's already completed?

What is the difference between calling return() on an iterator vs. next()?

What is the difference between when throw() is called on a generator vs. return() or next()?

By convention an iterator should not produce any more results after being called with =============.

is is possible to use a generator as a concise method on an object?

How do you execute a generator?  What is different about when you execute a generator vs.
executing a normal function

var a, b;

a = 3;					
b = 2 + a = 3;			
b = 2 + (a = 3);		

yield 3;			
a = 2 + yield 3;		
a = 2 + (yield 3);		
```

describe yield delegation and how it is used?

what will be console.logged in this code?

	console.log( v );
}
```

```javascript
function *foo(x) {
	if (x < 3) {
		x = yield *foo( x + 1 );
	}
	return x * 2;
}

var it = foo( 1 );
it.next();
```
```for of loops``` can be used to consume ==============.

What is returned in each of these ```next()``` calls. Why?
```javascript
function *foo() {
	yield 1;
	yield 2;
	yield 3;
}

var it = foo();

it.next();				

it.return( 42 );	

it.next();	
```

iterated over?

size?

what are the two ways to express an ```export```

there is no ================== scope in modules.

How to you export a module with an alias?

When a module is imported it is imported as a pointer meaning that...

What the difference in behavior when importing these two exports? what is the implication?
```javascript
function foo(..) {
	// ..
}

export default foo;
```
And this one:
```javascript
function foo(..) {
	// ..
}

export { foo as default };
```

es6 modules are intended to be (static or dynamic).

unlike object methods class methods are ==================.
